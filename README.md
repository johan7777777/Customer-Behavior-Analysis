# Customer Trends & Marketing Insights

## Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior trends, product performance, and marketing effectiveness using Python and SQL. The goal is to improve customer experience and optimize business strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, SQLAlchemy, MySQL-Connector
- **SQL**: MySQL for querying and analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data visualization and reporting

## Data Processing Workflow

### 1. Download & Load Data

#### Steps:
1. Download customer-related CSV files.
2. Convert CSV data into structured SQL tables.
3. Use Python to automate data insertion into MySQL.

#### Code Example (Python):
```python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector

# Read CSV files
file_paths = {
    "customer_journey": "customer_journey.csv",
    "customer_reviews": "customer_reviews.csv",
    "customers": "customers.csv",
    "engagement_data": "engagement_data.csv",
    "geography": "geography.csv",
    "products": "products.csv"
}
dfs = {name: pd.read_csv(path) for name, path in file_paths.items()}

# Fill missing values
for name, df in dfs.items():
    dfs[name] = df.fillna(df.mean(numeric_only=True))
```

#### SQL Table Creation Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

### 2. Data Extraction & Transformation

#### Steps:
1. Write SQL queries to extract relevant data.
2. Perform joins, window functions, CTEs, and subqueries for deeper insights.

#### SQL Query Example:
```sql
SELECT cj.JourneyID, c.CustomerName, p.ProductName, cj.VisitDate, 
       cj.Stage, cj.Action, cj.Duration
FROM customer_journey cj
JOIN customers c ON cj.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN products p ON cj.ProductID = p.ProductID;
```

### 3. Customer Journey & Engagement Analysis

#### Steps:
1. Identify drop-off points in the customer journey.
2. Analyze actions leading to successful conversions.
3. Calculate average time spent per stage.

#### SQL Query Example (Drop-off Analysis):
```sql
SELECT Stage, COUNT(*) AS DropOffCount
FROM customer_journey
WHERE Action = 'Drop-off'
GROUP BY Stage
ORDER BY DropOffCount DESC;
```

### 4. Customer Reviews Analysis

#### Steps:
1. Identify highest and lowest-rated products using SQL.
2. Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Python.
3. Correlate review trends with product performance.

#### SQL Query Example (Top & Lowest Rated Products):
```sql
SELECT p.ProductName, ROUND(AVG(cr.Rating), 2) AS AvgRating, COUNT(*) AS TotalReviews
FROM customer_reviews cr
JOIN products p ON cr.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY AvgRating DESC;
```

### 5. Marketing Effectiveness Analysis

#### Steps:
1. Calculate customer retention rate.
2. Compare repeat vs. first-time buyers.
3. Identify best-performing products per region.

#### SQL Query Example (Customer Retention Rate):
```sql
SELECT 
    (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN VisitDate >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR) THEN CustomerID END) 
     / COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID)) * 100 AS RetentionRate
FROM customer_journey;
```

## Key Findings

- **High Checkout Drop-Off**: 70% of customers abandon checkout due to complexity and additional costs.
- **Conversion Insights**: Only 30% of users complete purchases.
- **Top-Rated Products**: Football Helmet (5.0 stars), Lowest: Basketball (2.67 stars).
- **Best Performing Regions**: Austria (Running Shoes), Spain (Football Helmet).

## Recommendations

âœ… Simplify checkout process, display shipping costs upfront, and use cart reminders.  
âœ… Improve product pages with better images, descriptions, and customer reviews.  
âœ… Boost customer retention through loyalty programs and personalized recommendations.  
âœ… Target top-performing regions with country-specific marketing campaigns.  

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas mysql-connector-python sqlalchemy
   ```
2. Run `script.py` to load data into MySQL.
3. Execute `queries.sql` for analysis.
4. View insights and recommendations in the final report.

## Conclusion

By optimizing checkout, improving product pages, and targeting marketing efforts, businesses can increase conversions and customer loyalty. ðŸš€
